## Exercise 1.b)
Simulate a random walk, starting at 0 where at each time step the position is either increased
by 1 with probability 1/2 or decreased by 1 otherwise. Simulate many walks for N = 10, N = 100
and N = 1000 steps. Compare the results to (2). Find the relationship between the means and
variances.

```{r}
#Parameters
N_values<-c(10,100,1000)
sample<-20000

```

```{r}
#Function
par(mfrow=c(1,length(N_values)))

for(N in N_values){
  RW <- N-2*rbinom(sample,N,0.5)
  dd<-table(RW)/sample/2
  plot(dd,ylab = "Freq",xlab = "Pos", main=N)

  cat("The mean for walks of N=",N,"is",mean(dd),"\n")
  cat("The variance for walks of N=",N,"is",var(RW),"\n")
  
  
  
}
